Observing Optimization of Scarse Resources The case of maritime traffic. In a context of global disruptions (geopolitical tensions, pandemics, extreme weather), this internship focuses on modeling maritime traffic under resource scarcity. The goal is to simulate the collective behavior of shipping actors using Mean Field Game (MFG) models, in order to understand congestion dynamics and their impact on price formation.
